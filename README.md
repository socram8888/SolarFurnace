S4X8 SolarFurnace
=================

What is this?
-------------

This is a plugin designed for the [Bukkit]-based server Terranova, and gives the recently-introduced [Daylight Sensors] a new usage: power [Furnaces]! No more coal mining or burning wood! Its usage it's very simple: just place a Daylight Sensor on top of a Furnace!

As every solar panels, they require a strong light source, so they don't work in the Nether or the End, and they must be directly under the sky, with no opaque block (glass is OK) above it. You can still use Coal and any other kind of fuel in them as you will do with standard furnaces. Those fuels will be used when there's not enough light, for example at night.

Installation
------------

To install the plugin on your Bukkit server, you may either [download the pre-built version], or compile it yourself.

To compile it yourself, you need [Oracle Java Development Kit] v1.7 or newer, [Maven 2], and Git. When you have all of them downloaded and installed, you have to grab the source code using GIT and compile it:

	git clone https://github.com/socram8888/SolarFurnace
	cd SolarFurnace
	mvn clean package
	
Maven will automatically download all the dependencies. It may take more than five minutes if you have a slow internet connection, but usually it will take less than a minute.

The resulting compiled Java Archive file (.jar) ready to be used will be at /target. Just move it (or copy it) to Bukkit's plugin folder.
